# derive(Builder)

This crate provides `derive(Builder)` to easily implement the
[builder pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern). Much of the code is done by
following the [proc-macro-workshop](https://github.com/dtolnay/proc-macro-workshop) workshop and
Jon Gjenset's [livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geovSK3wMB8).
